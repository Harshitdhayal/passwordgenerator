Digital Store Room 

The Digital Store Room is a web-based application designed to store and manage digital items such as files, documents, notes, images, and links in one place. It works like a real storeroom where users can organize their digital data in folders and categories.

The project is developed using HTML for structure, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It provides a dashboard that shows storage usage, recent files, folders, and quick actions like file upload and folder creation.

Users can search items, upload files, create folders, add tags, and perform actions like download, edit, or delete. The interface is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project demonstrates the use of modern UI design and basic JavaScript logic to create an organized and user-friendly digital storage system.
